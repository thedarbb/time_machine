The attacks consisted of suicide attacks used to target symbolic U.S. building landmarks. The hijackers crashed planes into the World Trade Center in New York City, the Pentagon in Arlington County, and a field in Shanksville, after the passengers revolted. The attacks claimed the lives of 2,996 people (including 19 hijackers) and caused at least $10 billion in property and infrastructure damage.</p>
